This program was created to participate in PKM (Pengabdian Kepada Masyarakat) activities held by the campus. Also this program is aimed at children aged 9 - 12 years, our target group is RAKUS (Rak Buku Perpustakaan) located in BOJONG INDAH PARUNG BOGOR - WEST JAVA. The hope is that with this simple program, the children there can understand and get to know computers as early as possible.
